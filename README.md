# PathMaster

A* pathfinding in Unity 3D via AutoWaypoints.  This was part of a Unity game that didn't make it to market.  Since Unity now has pathfinding built-in, we are open-sourcing this for posterity.

## Getting Started

You will need all these classes (behaviors), with the possible exception of AutoWaypointTester, which adds real-time pathfinding to the editor.  Add the AutoWaypoing

### Prerequisites

This was written for Unity 3.x.  It may not work in later versions.  You are on your own.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

Copy the code to your unity project under PROJECT_ROOT/Assets or PROJECT_ROOT/Assets/Scripts


Use AutoWayPointOptions context menu to add waypoints.  Use the AutoWaypointNavigator behavior for any character who needs to navigate the waypoints.
